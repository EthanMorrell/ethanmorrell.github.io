The <a href="https://cms.ctahr.hawaii.edu/reeu">Data Driven Agriculture Research Experience and Extension for Undergraduates (REEU)</a> is a 9-week summer internship funded by the USDA. In 2023, I was accepted into this program along with nine other students. This program was unique in that it taught participants about plant, data, and computer sciences, and helped participants gain career development experience.
Over the course of the program, I got to participate in classroom learning, research activities, and field trips.

The program had three major segments:
The first few weeks consisted of gathering data and learning about statistics. Each student had a set of 20 maize plants to grow, monitor, and measure. After a certain level of plant growth was reached, each student terminated their samples and collected final measurements.
Over the next few weeks, we began to analyze the data we collected. I helped compile and clean the data to make sure that every student had access to it for their research.
During the last few weeks of the internship, we broke into subgroups to finalize our research and prepare for our final presentation. Once the data was compiled, we began coding in R to see what conclusions we could draw from analyzing it. As my groupâ€™s sole computer science student, I was the main coder, but every member participated in coding and contributed equally to the project as a whole.

Overall, this internship was a great experience for me. I learned a lot about many different subjects and tried things that were outside of my comfort zone.
For me, this internship served as a great introduction to R programming, machine learning, and academic research.
Along the way, I also developed my skills in teamwork, communication, presentation, problem solving, experimental design, and project management.
