## About the Project
This project was part of a submission for the annual James Campbell High School (JCHS) computer science department Hack-a-thon. Students formed groups of 6 to design and develop mobile applications.
The members of my group were all part of the JCHS Robotics club, so we decided to make an app that would benefit the robotics community. In robotics competitions, scouting is an essential practice. Gathering information on other teams and their respective robots is crucial for effectively collaborating with and competing against them. As such, we decided to create an app for teams to enter and store data collected on other teams in the <a href="https://www.vexrobotics.com/competition" target="_blank">VEX Robotics Competition.</a>

<b>Project Description:</b> Design/make a scouting app that can help organize statistics and information in a robotics competition such as VEX. Make it easier to organize and choose which team would be the best to make an alliance with and see who our opponents are and what they can do to plan out a strategy in advance.

## Group Roles
As part of this project, my team learned how to make a mobile app with Thunkable and use the Google Firebase API. We also learned about the software development process and practiced using SCRUM documentation.
All members of the group contributed equally to the final app. Each member was tasked with a specific function or page of the app, and was responsible for communicating with the other members to create a cohesive design. All members were responsible for implementing their assigned features and making a corresponding UI. As the project lead, I helped facilitate group discussions, tracked each memberâ€™s progress, and helped keep the overall project on schedule.
When the project was finished, my partners and I pitched our app to a panel of judges (composed of computer science teachers and community members). My team won first place in this competition for demonstrating excellence in our presentation and app design.
