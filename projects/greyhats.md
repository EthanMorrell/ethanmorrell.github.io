## About GreyHats
GreyHats is a Registered Independent Organization at UH Manoa (RIO). The club promotes cybersecurity and ethical hacking by hosting weekly informational meetings and endorsing and participating in cybersecurity competitions.

I first started attending GreyHats meetings in 2023. Although I already had some prior experience with cybersecurity, joining this club has boosted my overall knowledge and confidence. Since joining, I have participated in competitions like Hivestorm and the NSA’s CodeBreaker Challenge.

## Stepping into a Leadership Role
In December of 2023, I stepped up to become a board member of the club, and since January 2024 I have been serving as vice chairperson.

As vice chairperson, I help oversee the management of the club. In board meetings, I help organize the club’s schedule of events, meetings, and outreach activities. Also, along with the other board members, I have been tasked with leading a discussion topic in one of the general meetings

## My Takeaways
Through my participation in GreyHats, I have been able to practice my leadership, organizational, and communication skills. Furthermore, leading discussion topics has been a great learning experience. Doing so has forced me to research various topics in greater detail, and it has also given me the opportunity to practice my presentation skills.
