From a young age, I have had a passion for STEM. I was part of robotics teams from elementary through high school, and it was through these experiences that I first developed an interest in computer science. My first coding experience was in middle school, where I programmed autonomous routines for VEX robots in C++. I completed simple projects like navigating an obstacle course, using sensors to follow a path of electrical tape, and using a claw to manipulate and move around various objects.

In high school, I had even more opportunities to gain coding experience. I joined the “App Club,” where I learned to make simple web pages with HTML/CSS, and I learned basic JavaScript on the side to implement some finer touches. Through my high school’s AP Computer Science program and my continued involvement in robotics, I was able to improve my coding skills and learn more about the topic of computer science rather than just programming. Then, in my senior year, I founded a cybersecurity club to promote cybersecurity at my high school and create learning opportunities for myself and my peers.

Since then, my interests have always leaned towards cybersecurity, but I still like experimenting with different fields. Last summer, I had the opportunity to do a research internship with the Department of Tropical Plant and Soil Sciences at UH Manoa. In this internship, I collected data on a set of maize plants and then wrote code with the R programming language to analyze the data. Though this was not my forte, I am so grateful for the opportunity to go out of my comfort zone and see how computer science applies to a variety of industries.

Throughout my journey, I have made it a point to branch out and try new things within my area of interest. Even now, I hope to continue this trend in my personal endeavors and my classes at UH Manoa. This semester, I am eager to refresh my JavaScript skills and acquire new ones. In the first two weeks of my software engineering class, I have already learned several new things through my coursework, and I am excited to continue learning as I work on “real,” tangible projects. Though software development is not necessarily my forte, I am excited to have the opportunity to become more well-rounded as I learn about this field. I believe that the skills I acquire in programming, project management, and the development cycle will help me in my goals and personal projects moving forward.
